Use a class for passport info and functions
export this class back to index.

research a bit on keyup event listener
Or use submit event listener?

variables will need to be created for input of user data on the table.
variables for:
firstname
lastname
fullname
initials
valid name
which returns "Yes" (string) when the first name is at least 1 character long and 
the last name is at least 1 character long and the last name does NOT end with a dot character (.). 
In all other cases, it should return "No".

These will all need to be functions that are passed through the class.

# I've hardcoded my answers.

The next step is to make it dynamic using the input event listener.
Essentially my answer needs to be fed as a new class instance.
From here i then need to make sure the constructor is updated to accept this.
Then the instance methods too.

The input eventlistener will be working on the value.


Crate an object
The input even listener will be used from the object

i.e. 

let data = {
    firstname: '',
    lastname: '',
}

This object is passed into the class i.e.

let user = new Passport(data)

Constructor
constructor(data)
this.data = data

instance methods
return this.data.firstname
return this.data.lastname

What i've change is quite a bit!
i've passed the data object into the constructor class.
Then need to complete the rest of the instance methods.

Then hook this all up to an event listener, then will place the correct
info the ID's.
